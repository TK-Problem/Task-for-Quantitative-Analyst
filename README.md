# Task for Quantitative Analyst

## Project description

This project has 3 tasks for testing candidates analytical and technical skills.

1) `DATA MANIPULATION TASK`

Demonstrate your ability to:
- select random subsample of data set;
- filter desired rows using simple and more complex conditions;
- drop unnecessary variables, rename some variables;
- calculate summarizing statistics (for full sample and by categorical variables as well);
- create new variables using simple transformation and custom functions;
- order data set by several variables.

2) `DATA VISUALISATION TASK`

In order to understand the data please visualize it. You are free to select the scope, types of plots, etc.

3) `MODELLING TASK`

Perform a logistic regression to obtain the predicted probability that a customer has subscribed for a term deposit.
